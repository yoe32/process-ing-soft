# Cosmos DB Scenario Based Demos and Labs

This repo contains easy to deploy demos and detailed labs that show how to build end-to-end solutions for specific scenarios atop a common architecture that centers around Azure Cosmos DB.  

- **Demo**: The intent of the demo is to enable users to quickly get to showing an end-to-end solution working in their subscription, getting at the capabilities of Cosmos DB in the context of each of the scenario. It provides automation for deployment and minimizes any time spent manually configuring or provisioning resources in the target Azure subscription.

- **Labs:** The intent of the lab is to take participants step by step thru the setup and deployment of the key components of the solution deployed in the demo, providing guidance, teaching best practices and linking out to additional resources along the way.

##  Scenario 1 - Internet of Things (IoT)

In this scenario, you will use Azure Cosmos DB to ingest streaming vehicle telemetry data as the entry point to a near real-time analytics pipeline built on Cosmos DB, Azure Functions, Event Hubs, Azure Databricks, Azure Storage, Azure Stream Analytics, Power BI, Azure Web Apps, and Logic Apps.

### IoT demo

Follow the [step by step demo guide](./IoT/Demo%20step-by%20step%20-%20Cosmos%20DB%20scenario-based%20labs%20-%20IoT.md) for instructions on how to deploy the demo, and for a script that will help you understand the key points showcased. 

### IoT hands-on lab

The lab guides consists of two documents:

- Complete the [before the hands-on lab setup guide](./IoT/Before%20the%20HOL%20-%20Cosmos%20DB%20scenario-based%20labs%20-%20IoT.md) to understand the requirements and to get setup to run the lab in your own environment.
- Follow the [hands-on lab step-by-step guide](./IoT/HOL%20step-by%20step%20-%20Cosmos%20DB%20scenario-based%20labs%20-%20IoT.md) to get hands on constructing key components of the solution at your own pace.

##  Scenario 2 - Retail Recommendation System for e-Commerce

In this scenario, you will  implement a recommendation system for e-commerce using several Microsoft Azure services including Cosmos DB, Azure Functions, Event Hubs, Azure Databricks, Azure Storage, Azure Stream Analytics, Power BI, Azure Web Apps, and Logic Apps.

### Retail demo

Follow the [step by step demo guide](./Retail/Demo%20step-by-step%20-%20Cosmos%20DB%20scenario-based%20demo%20-%20Retail.md) for instructions on how to deploy the demo, and for a script that will help you understand the key points showcased.
